I'm a dedicated technologist and physicist with a passion for harnessing technology and physics to drive meaningful change. My work is fueled by an enduring curiosity about how the world works and a commitment to using innovative tools to improve lives and empower communities.

With a background rooted in hands-on experience and a deep understanding of scientific principles, I've earned knowledge that bridges the gap between theory and practical applications. Whether it's developing new technology solutions or exploring the intricate laws of physics, Iâ€™m constantly seeking for ways to advance collective understanding and create a positive impact.

Currently I am offering my freelance services as a maths/physics/coding tutor and as a website developer.
